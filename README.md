This is where your group will put your project, the Next Big Thing
in apps!

## General Requirements

You must implement the project in Dart, using Flutter.  You may use
external libraries from `pub.dev`, but you must list these in your
documents (proposal, milestones, and final report, as appropriate),
along with the reason you need them.

Your project must go beyond the topics we covered in class in some
significant way, and must somehow take advantage of features of a
mobile device (mobility, camera, motion sensors, etc.).

For reference, these are the topics we are covering:

 * Basic layout elements
 * Graphics and simple animation, including physics simulations
 * Permissions handling
 * Maps with user-tracking and annotations
 * Local key-value storage
 * Local file storage
 * Remote database access with Redis
 * Accessing accelerometer data
 * Creating alert dialogs and snackbars
 * Custom icons and sounds
 * Local notifications and background services

Here are _some_ topics we are not covering:

 * Push notifications from remote services
 * Using the camera
 * Using the microphone
 * Sprites or other complex animations
 * Additional third-party APIs, such as Firebase, Spotify, etc.

## Deliverables

You will need to submit the following things:

 1. a project proposal
 2. Milestone 1
 3. Milestone 2
 4. Milestone 3
 5. Final project, which must include
    * a working Flutter project
    * a 5-10 page report
    * a short (about 5 minutes) demonstration video

See below for details about these.

## How to Submit

Your project will be a series of commits, starting with a project proposal.
This proposal can be in markdown, plain text, or PDF, and should have an
obvious name. In addition, you should include a Flutter project, as with the
solo projects.

We will discuss your proposal with you, so that it is appropriately
scoped for difficulty (not too easy, nor too hard), and has
clearly-identified milestones, minimal goals, and stretch goals. There
will be three milestone submissions before the final
submission. **While your proposal includes milestone tasks, you
milestone submissions should be *time-based*, not progress-based.** That
is, we want you to submit milestone progress reports roughly every two
weeks. See below for more details.

The final submission must include the following:

 * a Flutter project that builds and runs on either an iPhone or
   Android platform
 * a 5-10 page (roughtly 2500 to 5000 words) report describing not just your
   app, but your design process, and how your ideas evolved over the course
   of the project
 * a 5 minute screen recording of your app, including audio description; several
   apps will be selected for in-class demonstration based on these

## Format of the Proposal

Your proposal should have the following format:

 * Project title
 * List of team members
 * General description of the app
 * Minimal Goals -- these are things your app *must* do
    * There should be roughly 5 distinct goals
    * At least one of the minimal goals must make specific use of the
      mobile environment, which might include using the camera, location,
      sensors, etc.
    * At least one of the minimal goals must go beyond what we are covering
      in class (see the General Requirements above)
 * Stretch Goals -- these are additional functionality that might earn
   extra points, and each must involve significant additional work
 * Project timeline, including development milestones

We have provided a sample proposal on ELMS that corresponds to the in-class
exercises. Your proposal will obviously have to include functionality beyond
what we will do for these exercises.

## Format of the Milestones

The milestones are progress reports. Whether you are ahead or behind on
your tasks, the milestones should be submitted roughly every two weeks
(see the syllabus for the expected submission dates). The purpose of these
is so that the grader for your group:

 * can see that you are making progress
 * knows what issues you are facing
 * can approve or provide feedback on proposed changes

If you are not proposing changes, your grader will mark your milestone
as Complete, possibly with some feedback. If you _are_ proposing
changes, a grade of Complete means the changes are acceptable, while a
grade of Incomplete means they have comments about your changes that
you need to incorporate.

Your milestone document should be named either `MilestoneX.txt`,
`MilestoneX.md`, or `MilestoneX.pdf`, where `X` is the milestone number
(1, 2, or 3). It must be committed to your repository and pushed to the
server.

In this, list what you have accomplished, and if you did not meet your
proposed target for the milestone, provide an updated schedule
illustrating how you will complete the project on time. Feel free to
include any design changes or lessons learned. These will be useful
when putting together your final report.

Your code should also be up-to-date on the server, so that we can
verify that actual progress is being made. It does not need to be
completely functional.

Please note that any real-world project is likely to require at least
slight schedule adjustments. *Don't panic if you didn't meet all of your
initial milestone goals!* The purpose of the milestones is for us to
check on your progress and provide feedback as needed.

## Format of the Final Report

The final report for your project should be titled `Final.txt`, `Final.md`,
or `Final.pdf`. It should have the following sections:

 * Title
 * Overview describing the motivation and high-level concept of the app
 * List of goals, where each is described, not just a bullet list
 * Walk-through of user interactions, including screen captures (the
   simulator has a built-in screenshot button)
 * Discussion of the development process, including when/how tasks were
   completed; any setbacks encountered; decisions and changes made to
   the initial plan; and what you learned, both about the development
   process and the features you used that were not covered in class
 * Potential future directions
