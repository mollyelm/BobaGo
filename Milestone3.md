## Milestone 3 Progress Report

### What We've Done

We've expanded on the core game interface and card system:

- Finalized all card designs with updated art
- Fixed the shake toggle in the settings menu and implemented tap functionality as an alternative
- Created a dynamic card playing field that adjusts spacing as cards are played
- Corrected point calculation methods for specific cards (like dessert cards and matcha cards)
- Implemented a harder CPU difficulty setting with "memory" of past hands
- Made sound effects toggleable in the settings menu
- Added a tutorial page with an embedded YouTube video showing how to play
- Switched from Spotify API to Audioplayers package for sound effects

### What We're Still Working On

We had to adjust our stretch goals due to time constraints:

- We decided not to implement the 3-player mode due to formatting and rendering issues
- We were unable to implement persistence for this milestone

### Next Steps

We are not on track with our project outline, as some of the stretch goals we planned to have done will not be implemented in time. 

Moving into our final submission, we'll:
- Make any final adjustments based on testing feedback
- Create our demonstration video
- Prepare final documentation
- We've shifted our focus from some of our original stretch goals to others, like implementing variable CPU difficulty instead of a third CPU opponent. 

Overall, we are happy with what we have created, and though we missed some stretch goals, we hit our main goals and a few stretch ones. The game is fun to play and we are proud of it.
