## Milestone 2 Progress Report

### What We've Done

We've expanded on the core game interface and card system:

- Fixed the game panel layout with more ideal-looking player/CPU areas
- Finished implementing score calculations for all card types
- Implemented CPU logic, dealing, and swapping hands to make the game playable
- Made the settings page mostly functional with working themes.
- Updated half of the cards with finalized image designs. 
- Made a functional statistics page 

### What We're Still Working On

Despite all of our efforts, we're still working towards the Spotify API. We are stuck on creating an AccessToken. If we cannot figure it out, we may swap to some other kind of audio API.

We also need to:
- Implement a second CPU opponent for three person games
- Save the game state and display
- Add animated cards and beautification

### Next Steps

Moving into Milestone 3, we'll:
1. Finish the card designs
2. Implement persistence
3. Animate the cards
4. Finish adding sound
5. As a stretch: Design a 3-player board and CPU logic for 3 players

We're still mostly on track for our original timeline. 

**Milestone 3:**
 * Implementing a second CPU opponent for three person games
 * Saving the game state and display
 * Animated cards and beautification
