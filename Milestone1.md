## Milestone 1 Progress Report

### What We've Done

We've built most of the core game interface and card system:

- Created the game panel layout with player/CPU areas
- Built the card class hierarchy
- Implemented score calculation for most card types
- Set up the player class to handle hands and played cards
- Designed the home page and settings menu

### What We're Still Working On

We're still working towards the Spotify API, as integration is taking a bit longer than expected. We're still figuring out how to work with Futures and async operations properly, so we'll tackle this in the next milestone. 

We also need to:
- Finish the more complicated card calculation methods
- Update card images with final designs
- Reduce load times on the game panel

### Next Steps

Moving into Milestone 2, we'll:
1. Finish the Spotify API integration
2. Complete the card game logic
3. Implement the turn-based game flow
4. Work on the CPU opponent
5. Start building the stats tracking system

We're still mostly on track for our original timeline. 

**Milestone 2:**
 * CPU should function as an opposing player
 * The player stats page should keep track of and display playerâ€™s stats
 * Functional settings menu

**Milestone 3:**
 * Implementing a second CPU opponent for three person games
 * Saving the game state and display
 * Animated cards and beautification
